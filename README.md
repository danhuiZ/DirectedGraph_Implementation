# DirectedGraph_Implementation
In this program, the DirectedGraphEdge class has the common getter methods and weight setter method. The toString() method was overridden but not needed. Per Object-Oriented Programming principle, the DirectedGraphNode class has addEdge method and updateWeightIfHasEdge method to aid the main DirectedGraph class in addition to the requested getClosestNode method to get the closest neighbor. In the DirectedGraph class, AddNode, AddEdge and getNeighbors methods are implemented as requested and unit tested. An addition closestNodeKey method was written using DirectedGraphNode class’ getClosestNode method to return the key of the closest neighbor’s key if the neighbor is not null. This helps in the breadthFirstClosest method implementation. In addition, note the generic class needs to extend Comparable in order for two generic objects to be compared.
